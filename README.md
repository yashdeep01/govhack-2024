## Problem Statement
As outer suburbs in Victoria continue to experience rapid population and housing growth, one of the most pressing challenges facing by the Victorian Government is ensuring equitable access to public transportation services, including buses and trains. The Victorian Governmentâ€™s Growing Suburbs Fund (GSF) is a targeted initiative aimed at addressing the high-priority local infrastructure needs of rapidly expanding outer suburbs. This fund seeks to increase social and economic participation, meet health and wellbeing needs, and enhance local economic activity through strategic investments in infrastructure.  

Public transportation, including both train and bus services, is a critical component of the infrastructure, as it plays a crucial role in supporting commuting, connectivity, and overall community engagement. While the GSF aims to address a range of infrastructure needs, the issue of inadequate public transportation services remains a significant concern that cannot be overlooked. Former Public Transport Users Association president Daniel Bowen has pointed out that many rapidly growing suburbs, including Wyndham Vale, Tarneit, Cranbourne, and Clyde, face challenges with insufficient local bus routes. Similar issues are evident with train services in densely populated suburbs, such as Tarneit and Criaigeburn, which have seen substantial influxes of new migrants. This indicates a gap that needs to be addressed even as broader infrastructure improvements are underway.  

In response to this challenge, it is essential to first understand the current state of public transportation by conducting a thorough historical analysis and developing forecasts for the future. This approach requires data-driven insights to identify key trends and pinpoint where gaps in bus and train services are most pronounced. Only with a clear, evidence-based understanding of how transportation services have evolved and where demand is headed can we ensure that future infrastructure investments are strategically targeted.
This problem touches on several critical areas:  

- **Distribution of Bus and Train Services**: Ensuring that public transportation is equitably distributed across all outer suburbs is important. Rapidly growing areas with limited services need to be prioritized, and the availability of transport should be aligned with both current and projected population and housing growth.
- **Impact on Life Satisfaction**: Access to reliable public transportation has a direct effect on people's overall life satisfaction. Commute times, convenience, and access to jobs or services influence well-being and social participation. Effective transportation planning can improve quality of life, particularly in suburbs where long or inefficient commutes are common.  
- **Social and Economic Participation**: Public transportation plays a critical role in connecting people to economic opportunities, education, healthcare, and social networks. A lack of adequate services can lead to isolation and reduced economic participation, further exacerbating inequality in rapidly growing suburbs.
Certainly, additional factors such as connectivity, timeliness, and other critical areas of public infrastructure need to be considered for effective community planning. These will be addressed in future plans as we work with the team and the government to enhance our initiative.  


## Our Solution
**TransitPulse Explorer** is an innovative application designed to help city planners, policymakers, and the broader community understand potential future scenarios of public transport provisions through the analysis of historical and current planning data. It serves as a comprehensive decision-support tool that not only helps policymakers formulate sustainable urban development strategies but also provides valuable insights for the general public to make informed decisions about their future movements.  

By integrating past trends with future forecasts, TransitPulse Explorer helps to identify emerging needs, optimize transportation planning, and enhance community engagement, ultimately supporting more effective and responsive urban development.  
On this application, stakeholders can visualize the population, household, and dwelling growth patterns between 2021 and 2026 to gain insights into the evolving situation in Victoria, Australia.  

We also construct a Transit Equity Index for each Local Government Area (LGA). This index measures the number of bus and train trips relative to the population, households, or dwellings within each LGA. It is calculated as follows:  


**Transit Equity Index = Number of Bus and Train Trips / Population or Household or Dwelling**  


This index reflects the relative accessibility and adequacy of public transportation services within each LGA. A higher index value indicates a greater availability of public transport relative to the number of people, households, or dwellings, suggesting better access to transit services. Conversely, a lower index value points to a potential shortfall in public transportation coverage, highlighting areas where additional services may be needed.  

By evaluating the Transit Equity Index, stakeholders can identify disparities in transit accessibility, prioritize areas for infrastructure investment, and develop strategies to ensure equitable public transportation services across all regions, particularly in rapidly growing suburbs.
